# 🧠 Function Finder – Python Logic Hub  
An interactive **Gradio-based UI** that allows users to run multiple Python logic functions such as prime checking, factorial, sorting, anagrams, gcd, lcm, merging arrays, and more.

This project provides:
- A clean and responsive UI  
- Automatic source code display  
- Detailed description for each function  
- Support for single-input and dual-input functions  
- A centralized function registry system

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Run Python logic functions with a simple interface  
Choose a function from a dropdown, enter input(s), and instantly see the output.

### ✔ View the source code automatically  
Every time a function is executed, its Python source code is displayed.

### ✔ Built-in function descriptions  
Each function has:
- Description  
- Expected Input format  
- Expected Output format  

These are fetched dynamically from **FUNCTION_DESCRIPTIONS_COMPLETE**.

### ✔ Supports single and dual-argument functions  
Examples:
- Single input: `factorial(5)`  
- Two inputs: `gcd(10, 20)`  
- Array functions: `merge_arrays([1,3], [2,4])`  

### ✔ Modular structure  
Functions are stored in `Functions.py` and descriptions in `Descriptions.py`.
